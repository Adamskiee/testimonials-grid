## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

1. Position
```html
<div
class="card bg-purple-500 text-white relative lg:col-span-2"
>
    <img
        src="images/bg-pattern-quotation.svg"
        class="hidden lg:block absolute z-1 top-0 right-16"
        alt=""
    />
    ...
    <h2 class="content__subject relative z-10">
        I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
        current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
        got every penny's worth.
    </h2>
    ...
</div>
```

### Continued development

1. I want to learn more about how can I use layouts in complex projects.

### Useful resources

- [W3schools](w3schools.com) - This helped me to visualize how CSS properties works
